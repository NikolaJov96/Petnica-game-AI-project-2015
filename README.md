# Petnica-game-AI-project-2015

I worked on this project at Petnica Science Center during my fourth year of high school.

This repo contains a full file dump of the project, including Python scripts, posters and the final paper, all in the Serbian language.

You can look at the source code at your own risk, as I stand today completely baffled by the fact that this code worked and produced valid results.

Final files can be found on the following links:

Following is the final paper abstract in English:

<blockquote>
<b>Autonomus computer game playing inspired by "Deep Learning" principles</b>
</br></br>
This paper demonstrates how we can use simple machine learning method for playing simple computer games. For that purpose we implemented Tic-Tac-Toe game and racing game from Brick Game console, as examples of logic and arcade games. In this paper we used universal algorithms which neither depend on the specific chosen game, nor they know anything about rules or goals of the game. Algorithms have information about current state of the screen (matrix of pixels) and they are able to perform certain actions. Those actions can not be directly correlated to the actual intended gameplay. Games are designed so that they are calculating algorithm's efficiency and sending that information back to the algorithm along with the current screen data. Tic-tac-toe algorithm was designed to play against an opponent playing completely random moves, in order to have a chance of winning. If a game was successful, algorithm would increase the probability of repeating the same strategy, while in the opposite case, the same probability would decrease. Racing game algorithm is based only on avoiding loosing a life. Described algorithms successfully learned to play games they were tested on, keeping in mind that games were simple, as well as the algorithms. More complex games require more complex methods, so algorithms used here are not able to play "shooter" games.
